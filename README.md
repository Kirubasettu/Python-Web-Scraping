# Python-Web-Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It’s a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning.
# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a web-scraping tool to extract specific data from target websites(Github). The scraped data will be used for Specify Purpose – e.g., market research, data analysis, content aggregation, etc..
### Identify Target Websites:
- List the websites from which data needs to be scraped.
- Consider the structure and layout of each website to plan the scraping strategy.
### Define Data to Extract:
- Specify the types of data to be extracted (e.g., text, images, links, etc.).
- Clearly define the structure of the data to ensure accurate extraction.
### Develop Scraping Script:
- Choose a suitable programming language for web scraping ( Python,).
- Utilize web scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup) to interact with web pages and extract data.
### Data Cleaning and Processing:
- Clean and process the extracted data to remove any irrelevant or duplicate information.
- Convert the data into a structured format ( CSV) for further analysis.
### Testing and Validation:
- Test the scraper on various target websites to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
- Validate the extracted data against the expected results.
### Documentation:
- Provide comprehensive documentation for the code, including instructions for setting up and running the scraper.
- Document any challenges faced during the scraping process and how they were addressed.
### Deliverables:
- Complete, well-documented web scraping script.
- Extracted data in a structured format.
- Documentation on how to use and maintain the scraping tool.
